# PySpec
This is an analysis package made for the application of spectral decompositions for dimensionality reduction on Python

## Motivation
This package is meant to help provide a set of tools for use in analyzing data using spectral decompositions beginning with SSA,
MSSA, and tensor decompositions along with accompanying plotting and statistical testing tools. On a personal note, this is supposed
